Recently, I faced a challenging issue while working on my SkillSync Resume Optimizer project. The platform started slowing down whenever several users tried generating resume suggestions at once, which affected the overall experience. After digging into the problem, I realized the slowdown was caused by an inefficient keyword matching logic and multiple API calls running one after another. I redesigned the backend flow, optimized the data processing, and introduced parallel execution where possible. These changes helped bring down the API response time by around 18% and also made the skill detection accuracy noticeably better. Solving this taught me how to identify real performance bottlenecks and handle debugging under pressure. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that made me more confident in my engineering and problem solving abilities.
